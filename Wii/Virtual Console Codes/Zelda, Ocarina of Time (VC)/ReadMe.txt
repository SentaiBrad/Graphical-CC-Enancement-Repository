Use the Patcher64+ Tool and apply the "Expand Memory" option to Ocarina of Time in order for the Action Replay Codes to work.

Expand Memory is used for Redux and other larger type ROM hacks. Vanilla Ocarina of Time has no issue running with 8MB RAM (as opposed to 4MB RAM).
This ensures compatability with both Redux and Vanilla Ocarina of Time while using the same Action Replay codes.

Redux is NOT required as Action Replay code will still work without it.

This only applies to the US (NTSC-U) version. EU (PAL) or JPN (NTSC-J) requires different codes.

For more enhancements for the US version, check out the Patcher64+ Tool at: https://github.com/Admentus64/Patcher64Plus-Tool/releases.
