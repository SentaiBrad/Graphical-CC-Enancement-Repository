# Graphical-CC-Enancement-Repository
A repository for cheat codes that enhance the graphical quality for several emulators.

Many different emulators have websites, discords, wiki's and places where people post codes that enhance the game that they are playing. Wether that be Draw Distance, Shadow Quality, Widescreen patches that do not distort 2D Elements, or any number of things that do not provide an unfair advantage in that game. 

Some emulators like PCSX2 and Dolphin have GREAT repositories on their own websites for this type of thing. Other consoles have many emulators that are usable, and subsequently do not have a good repository for codes and patches. 

This repository would like to change that. When attempting to look for PS1 codes recently I was upset that there was no singular location that held good knowledge, so I made it.

This will be a community effort. If you create or find codes online that will benefit the community, make a pull request and submit the information.

When submitting, if you are not the creator of the codes, please link and credit the creator.

I test codes primarily in RetroArch on a Windows PC, and Android on an AYN Odin Pro.
