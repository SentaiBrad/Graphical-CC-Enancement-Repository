PCSX2 uses .pnach files to list their codes.  The code files are named after the CRC for their respective game. The files reside in "..\pcsx2 location\cheats" or "..\pcsx2 location\cheats_ws". "cheats_ws" is for widescreen patches specfiically, and the rest reside in "Cheats"

PNACH files are sorted in to sub-folders based on their game names.

"//" is used to comment out a line so that PCSX2 ignores it. Leave "//" in front of patch names. You can add "//" in front of a list of codes to disable them, and remove "//" to enable them.
